## About

I am a PhD candidate in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder. My research focuses on the dynamics and predictability of marine stressors, with a particular focus on ocean acidification. I received a BS in Environmental Science and BA in Global Environments and Sustainability from the University of Virginia in 2020.
